## libraries utilized
##      NOTE: if you don't have these installed you will need to 
##      install them... install.packages("name of package")
library(plyr); library(dplyr); library(tidyr)
## ALL COURSE DATA
## COURSE ENROLLMENT AND SCH GENERATED
## Step 1: Download the course files and save them as csv files
##              Note: the Grade data will not be available until 
##              the mid-term next semester.
## Step 2: Setting the working directory
setwd("V:/dept/SRA/Enrollment/Enrollment--Fall, Spring, and Summer/Rscript to Combine Official Data")
## Step 4: Import the course enrollment file and prepare
stus <- read.csv("./Data/Course/course_enrollment.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
        ## lower casing the colnames
colnames(stus) <- tolower(colnames(stus))
        ## selecting the necessary columns and aggregating the students.
stus <- stus %>% select(setid, 
                        academic_term, 
                        student_inst_id,
                        course_sec_identifier,
                        course_attempted_hrs, 
                        course_enrollment_ind) %>%
        filter(course_enrollment_ind == "CNTENRLY") %>%
        group_by(setid, 
                 academic_term, 
                 course_sec_identifier) %>%
        summarize(number_enrolled = n(), 
                  sch_generated = sum(course_attempted_hrs))
## Step 5: Import in the course name file and prepare
course <- read.csv("./Data/Course/course_section.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
        ## lower casing the names
colnames(course) <- tolower(colnames(course))
        ## selecting the necessary columns.
course <- course %>% select(course_sec_identifier, 
                            course_acronym, 
                            course_number, 
                            course_section_code, 
                            course_section_name, 
                            section_instruction_type, 
                            department_code, 
                            campus_code)
## Step 6: pulling in the faculty who teaches the courses and preparing the faculty
fac <- read.csv("./Data/Course/course_faculty.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
        ## lower casing the column names
colnames(fac) <- tolower(colnames(fac))
        ## selecting the primary faculty
fac <- fac %>% filter(primary_faculty_ind == "Y") %>%
        select(course_sec_identifier, 
               faculty_inst_id)
## Step 7: Combining the information together
results <- course %>% join(fac) %>% 
        join(stus)
## Step 8: fixing the course department code
##      Note: You will need to double check Data Warehouse 
##      to make sure that no department has changed
##      function to find unique department codes:
##      sort(unique(results$department_code))

## Step 9: Assigning the Course College

## Step 10: Fixing the faculty department and faculty college
        ## will need to take the faculty id, faculty department, 
        ## faculty college code, and employment status code out
        ##  of data warehouse for the current term.
        ## will need to import the information to attach the information
fac.college <- read.csv("./Data/Course/faculty_college_dept_timestatus.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
colnames(fac.college) <- tolower(colnames(fac.college))
        ## fixing the faculty course college

fac.college$fac_college_initial[fac.college$fac_college_code == 1] <- "COAS"

        ## removing the faculty college code
fac.college <- fac.college[, -2]
        ## renaming the faculty id to match
colnames(fac.college)[1] <- "faculty_inst_id"
        ## adding the faculty information to the results

        ##Finding the ones that are missing
results[which(is.na(results$fac_college_initial) &
                      !is.na(results$faculty_inst_id)), c(9,18)]
        ## use data warehouse to find the most recent
        ## college and department to add to the missing info
        ## Missing indiviual One
results$fac_department[results$faculty_inst_id == Place ID Number here] <- "Place Depart here'
results$employment_status[results$faculty_inst_id == Place ID Number here] <- "Place Time status here"
results$fac_college_initial[results$faculty_inst_id == Place ID Number here] <- "Place College Initials Here"
        ## Assigning the remaining the Non-VSU faculty ID

results$course_level_desc[results$course_level > 2] <- "Upper Division"
results$course_level_desc[results$course_level > 4] <- "Graduate"
## Step 12: creating a course campus description

results$campus_desc[results$campus_code == "6"] <- "eCore Campus"
## Step 13: creating a course campus grouping
results$campus_group[results$campus_code == "A"] <- "Main Campus"
results$campus_group[results$campus_code == "5"] <- "Online"
results$campus_group[results$campus_code == "Z"] <- "Off Campus"

results$campus_group[results$campus_code == "C"] <- "Off Campus"
results$campus_group[results$campus_code == "DHY"] <- "Off Campus"
results$campus_group[results$campus_code == "GML"] <- "Online"
results$campus_group[results$campus_code == "6"] <- "Online"
## Step 14: creating insturction type desc
results$section_instruction_desc[results$section_instruction_type == 10] <- "Lecture"
results$section_instruction_desc[results$section_instruction_type == 11] <- "Lect/SupLab"
results$section_instruction_desc[results$section_instruction_type == 12] <- "Lect/UnsupLab"
results$section_instruction_desc[results$section_instruction_type == 20] <- "Seminar"
results$section_instruction_desc[results$section_instruction_type == 30] <- "Sup Lab"
results$section_instruction_desc[results$section_instruction_type == 40] <- "Unsup Lab"
results$section_instruction_desc[results$section_instruction_type == 50] <- "Indep Study"
results$section_instruction_desc[results$section_instruction_type == 55] <- "Directed Study"
results$section_instruction_desc[results$section_instruction_type == 57] <- "Asynchronous"
results$section_instruction_desc[results$section_instruction_type == 60] <- "Prac Teach"
results$section_instruction_desc[results$section_instruction_type == 70] <- "Internship"
results$section_instruction_desc[results$section_instruction_type == 80] <- "Practicium"
results$section_instruction_desc[results$section_instruction_type == 81] <- "Intern/Pratic"
results$section_instruction_desc[results$section_instruction_type == 90] <- "Thesis/Diss"
results$section_instruction_desc[results$section_instruction_type == 91] <- "Thesis"
results$section_instruction_desc[results$section_instruction_type == 92] <- "Dissertation"
results$section_instruction_desc[results$section_instruction_type == NA] <- "Undefined"
## Step 15: kicking the data out
write.csv(results, "official_course_hours_generated.csv")
